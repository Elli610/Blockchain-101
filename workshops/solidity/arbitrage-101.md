# MEV Arbitrage 101

# Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this material, students must have:

Previous experience with Solidity: Students should be comfortable with Solidity syntax, contract development, and deployment processes

Understanding of AMM mechanisms: Students must have a solid grasp of Automated Market Maker concepts, including liquidity pools, price discovery, and trading mechanisms

## Introduction
Welcome! This is a hands-on workshop designed to introduce you to **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)** through practical arbitrage trading on an EVM-compatible blockchain.  

I have deployed **10 ERC20 tokens** and created **17 Uniswap pools**.  
Each token‚Äôs base value corresponds to its index:  
Here's the markdown table:

| Token | Address | Value |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Token1 | address1 | **1** |
| Token2 | address2 | **2** |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Token10 | address10 | **10** | 

The pools are initialized with prices reflecting these relative values. Your mission is to build an **arbitrage bot** that listens to swap events, finds profitable routes, and executes trades to maximize profit.  

At the end of the competition, the wallet with the **most points** wins!

## üìä Scoring System

- **5 points**: Continuously listen for Uniswap swap events  
- **8 points**: Build a working arbitrage bot  
  - Extract prices from pools ‚Üí **2 points**  
  - Find profitable arbitrage routes ‚Üí **3 points**  
  - Execute arbitrage transactions ‚Üí **3 points**  
- **7 points**: Performance bonus based on profit ranking  

### üí° Extra Points & Challenges
- Write your own contract to guarantee profitability on each arbitrage  
- Capture **pending transactions** from the mempool and react before they are mined  
- Implement **advanced path-finding algorithms** for multi-hop arbitrage  
- Pay attention to trade profitability & save gas fees

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- You may use **JavaScript / TypeScript**, **Rust**, or **Go**  
- **Python** is possible but not recommended due to weaker Web3 ecosystem support  

Arbitrage transactions **must** be executed via the Uniswap Router‚Äôs **multicall** function:

## üõ† Exercises

### 1. Listening for Events (5 points)

* Subscribe to `Swap` events in the pools
* Log every swap in real time

---

### 2. Building the Arbitrage Bot (8 points)

#### 2.1 Extract Prices (2 points)

* Fetch token reserves from Uniswap pools
* Compute exchange rates between all pairs

#### 2.2 Find Profitable Routes (3 points)

* Detect arbitrage opportunities between pools
* Example: Token A ‚Üí Token B ‚Üí Token C ‚Üí back to Token A with profit

#### 2.3 Execute Transactions (3 points)

* Send arbitrage trades through the **Uniswap Router multicall**
* Ensure gas costs < arbitrage profit

---

### 3. Competing for Performance (7 points)

* Continuously run your bot
* The more profitable trades you capture, the higher your score!
