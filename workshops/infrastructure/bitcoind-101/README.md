# Bitcoind 101

## Introduction
Welcome to this hands-on workshop that will guide you through setting up and managing your own Bitcoin node! This workshop is split into two main parts:
1. Setting up and interacting with a Bitcoin node (bitcoind)
2. Deploying and managing an Electrum server

This workshop is designed for developers interested in understanding Bitcoin's infrastructure layer and gaining practical experience with node operation.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of command line operations
- Familiarity with Bitcoin concepts
- A machine with at least:
  - 1TB of free disk space (for blockchain data and electrum server) -> Be aware this is a minimum requirement, the Bitcoin blockchain is growing and you may need more space in the future
  - 6GB RAM
  - Stable internet connection
  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later recommended or wsl2 on Windows)
  -  SSH or physical access to your server

## Workshop Structure
The workshop is divided into two main components:
- Part 1: Bitcoin Node Setup ([`bitcoind-setup.md`](./bitcoind-setup.md))
  - Installing bitcoind
  - Configuring your node
  - Syncing with the network
  - Basic node operations and monitoring
  - Interacting with your node using bitcoin-cli

> Note: Syncing the Bitcoin blockchain can take several days. Ensure you have enough disk space and a stable internet connection before starting.

- Part 2: Electrum Server Setup ([`electrum-setup.md`](./electrum-setup.md))
  - Installing Electrum Server
  - Connecting to your Bitcoin node
  - Server configuration
  - Managing and monitoring your Electrum server
  - Connecting Electrum wallet to your server

> Note: The Electrum server setup will have to sync with the Bitcoin node, which can take multiple days depending on your hardware.

## Getting Started
1. Follow the instructions in `bitcoind-setup.md` for Part 1
2. Once your Bitcoin node is fully synced, proceed to `electrum-setup.md` for Part 2

## Learning Objectives
After completing this workshop, you will:
- Understand how to set up and maintain a Bitcoin node
- Know how to interact with the Bitcoin network directly
- Be able to run your own Electrum server
- Understand the relationship between Bitcoin nodes and Electrum servers
- Have hands-on experience with Bitcoin's infrastructure layer

## Important Notes
- Full synchronization of the Bitcoin blockchain can take several days
- Ensure you have adequate disk space before starting
- The setup process requires following security best practices
- Some commands may require sudo privileges

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions are documented in each respective guide. If you encounter problems not covered in the documentation, please open an issue in this repository.

The best website I found to easily setup a bitcoin node and add a ton of really cool updates is [citadel.org](https://citadels.org/nodeupgrade/).
Most of the information in this workshop is from there.
